#I have queried a database with multiple tables in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data in this SQL.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) as iPhone_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum,
customers.order_id,
FebSales.orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE orderdate <> 'Order Date'
ORDER BY acctnum;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product,
price as min_price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price as revenue,
product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product <> 'Product'
AND length(product) >=6
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
